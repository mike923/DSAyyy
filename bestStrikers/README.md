# Best Strikers

## Problem

At the end of the season a soccer team has all of the stats of their players. Create an algorithm that will take in all the data of the strikers and return a sorted array of all the strikers data.

``` js
 # Input
    const strikers = [{
        name: "Ronaldo",
        goals: 78,
    }, {
        name: "Messi",
        goals: 78
    }]
```
