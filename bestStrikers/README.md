# Best Strikers

## Problem

At the end of the season a soccer team has all of the stats of their players. Create an algorithm that will take in all the data of the strikers and return a sorted array of all the strikers data.


## Example

### Input

```js
const strikers = [
  {
    name: "Gree Bun",
    goals: 72,
  },
  {
    name: "Speak Chet",
    goals: 78,
  },
  {
    name: "Oval Redd",
    goals: 67,
  },
  {
    name: "Mark Expo",
    goals: 78,
  },
];
```

### Output

```js
[
  {
    name: "Speak Chet",
    goals: 78,
  },
  {
    name: "Mark Expo",
    goals: 78,
  },
  {
    name: "Gree Bun",
    goals: 72,
  },
  {
    name: "Oval Redd",
    goals: 67,
  },
];
```
